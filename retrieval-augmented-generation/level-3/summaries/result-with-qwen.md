In 1633, Galileo Galilei stood before the Inquisition, not for inventing a radical new theory, but for proposing a straightforward idea: that the Earth moves around the Sun. This wasn’t even a new suggestion—Greek astronomers like Aristarchus had floated the heliocentric model centuries earlier. But in Galileo’s time, the idea ran into an insurmountable obstacle.

We often chalk up the Church’s resistance to superstition or ignorance. While that played a role, there was something deeper at work. The Church wielded immense power, but that power ultimately depended on the beliefs of the people. For society to function as the Church wanted, people needed to carry certain information in their heads—ideas that shaped how they behaved, what they valued, and whom they trusted. The Church had mastered the art of narrative dominance, building a system of stories, symbols, and doctrines that made its authority seem natural and inevitable. The geocentric model was one of the cornerstones of this narrative system.

The geocentric model formed a core part of Church doctrine and daily life. For example, Psalm 104:1-6 (KJV) reads:

Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty. Who coverth thyself with light as with a garment: who stretcheth out the heavens like a curtain: Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind: Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire: Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever. Thou coverth it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.

Likewise, Joshua 10:12-13 (KJV) describes:

Then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon. And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.

These passages were cited as literal proof that the Earth was stationary and central. This cosmic arrangement justified humanity’s special status: sermons and theological writings argued that God placed humans at the center of the universe, making them the focus of divine attention and salvation. The structure of the cosmos—Earth at the center, surrounded by concentric spheres of planets, stars, and heaven—mirrored the Church’s vision of a divinely ordained social and spiritual hierarchy.

You could see this worldview in action throughout Christian life. The Church’s liturgical calendar—including the calculation of Easter—relied on the apparent movements of the Sun and Moon around a stationary Earth. Cathedrals like San Petronio in Bologna were equipped with meridian lines and astronomical clocks, turning the very architecture into solar observatories for tracking the heavens as seen from Earth’s center. In art, illuminated manuscripts and stained glass windows depicted the universe as a series of concentric spheres, with Earth at the heart of creation. The rose windows of Gothic cathedrals, with their radiating spokes, visually echoed the cosmic order, while creation scenes in church art often showed God setting the Sun, Moon, and stars in motion around a central Earth.

Miracles described in the Bible, like the Sun standing still for Joshua, made sense only in a geocentric universe. Even the moral order—the idea that the corrupt Earth was surrounded by the pure heavens—depended on this model. Accepting heliocentrism would have meant unraveling a whole tapestry of beliefs, not just about the stars, but about God, humanity, and the Church’s place in the world.

The Church’s worldview was a bonafide conceptual cathedral. Its visible rituals and teachings rested on a hidden architecture of interlocking ideas, each supporting and reinforcing the others. At the very foundation was the belief that Christianity—and specifically the Church—was the sole authority on interpreting reality. The geocentric model was a crucial supporting pillar: it was drawn directly from scripture and literally carved into the intellectual and physical fabric of Christian society. To question geocentrism was to question the explanatory power of scripture itself, and by extension, the Church’s authority to define what was true.
