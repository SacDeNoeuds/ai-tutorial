# Facts Don't Change Minds

People rarely change their views because they're presented with new facts or data. Instead, we tend to:

- **Ignore** information that contradicts our beliefs.
- **Cherry-pick** data that supports our views.
- **Double down** on our stance when faced with opposing arguments.

This is known as 'confirmation bias' and it's a major obstacle in productive discussions. To overcome this, try to:

- **Listen actively** to other viewpoints.
- **Ask open-ended questions** to understand different perspectives.
- **Focus on shared values** rather than polarizing issues.
